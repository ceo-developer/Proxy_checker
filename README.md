Example 1: Checking proxies from a file  
```
Enter Proxy List File (or type 'auto' to fetch from API): proxies.txt
Enter Proxy Type (socks4/socks5/http/https): https
Enter Number of Threads (default 50): 100
```

Example 2: Fetching Proxies Automatically  
```
Enter Proxy List File (or type 'auto' to fetch from API): auto
```

📂 Output Files:  
- ✅ Working Proxies: `https_working_proxies.json`  
- ❌ Not Working Proxies: `not_working_proxies.txt`

📝 Output Format  
The working proxies will be saved in JSON format like this:  
```json
[
    {
        "proxy": "123.45.67.89:8080",
        "latency": 0.534,
        "country": "United States",
        "city": "New York",
        "anonymity": "Elite"
    }
]
```

🔧 How It Works  
1️⃣ Loads proxies from a file or API sources  
2️⃣ Uses multi-threading for fast validation  
3️⃣ Checks each proxy by sending requests to an API  
4️⃣ Saves working proxies with response time, country, and anonymity level
